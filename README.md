# ERC_Reservation_System

## Project Overview
This project implements a producer-consumer-based solution using Java to handle the print jobs in ShinePrinters. The system includes support for different file types, and a web interface that allows customers to submit print jobs remotely before coming to the shop.

## Technologies Used
Java
Getting Started
To set up the project, follow these steps:

## Handling Concurrency and Exceptions
The project addresses memory consistency errors and other concurrency issues that may arise in the multi-threaded system. The TypeNotSupportedException is implemented to handle situations where the printers cannot process certain file types. The Computer and Printer classes are extended to handle this exception.

## Web Interface
The ReadAFile method is implemented to read a given text file and add its content to a TextFile class object. This supports the web interface that allows customers to submit print jobs remotely before coming to the shop.

## Best Practices
The code follows appropriate best practices, such as proper exception handling, thread-safe implementation, and clear separation of concerns.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future enhancements for the ShinePrinters system include:

## Support for additional file types
Improved web interface with more features
Advanced scheduling and prioritization of print jobs
